  "faqQuestion9": "Can I use the app offline?",

  "faqQuestion10": "How do I sign out of my account?",
  "faqAnswer10": "To sign out, go to your Profile screen and tap the \"Logout\" button. You'll be asked to confirm before signing out.\n\nMake sure all your tasks are synced before signing out to avoid losing any data.",
